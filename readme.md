# Hi, I'm Tanisha Downer! Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

As a **Computer Science student at Oakland City University**, I focus on developing strong foundations in computer science, cybersecurity, and information technology while gaining hands-on experience through internships and campus leadership roles. My academic and professional interests center on applying technical knowledge to real-world problems through data-driven solutions, system optimization, and process improvement.

Alongside my coursework, I have gained practical experience as a **Ticket Workflow Coordinator Intern**, where I support IT service operations by managing ticket workflows, monitoring SLA compliance, and building Power BI dashboards to improve visibility and efficiency. I also bring experience in infrastructure support, cloud technologies, and automation from previous internships, working with tools such as Azure, PowerShell, and network monitoring platforms.

I am passionate about continuous learning, bridging the gap between theory and practice, and building solutions that improve operational performance. My goal is to pursue a career in technology where I can combine analytical thinking, technical expertise, and collaboration to create impactful, scalable systems.
